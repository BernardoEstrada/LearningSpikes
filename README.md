# Language Spikes

This repository contains a collection of small programs, or "spikes," that I am using to explore and learn different programming languages. Each spike is a simple program that is designed to test out a particular language feature or concept, and to provide a starting point for further exploration.

## Languages

Here is a list of the languages that are currently included in this repository:

- Elixir
- Dart
- Julia
- Go
- Rust
- Swift

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always looking to learn more about different languages, and I would be happy to include your spikes in this collection.
